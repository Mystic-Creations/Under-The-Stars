# Description
**Under The Stars** is a small camping mod, mainly designed just so you can enjoy some snacks and enjoy the scenery of the minecraft world at night, sleeping under the stars, sitting around the campfire alone or with friends, simply having fun. Although, the mod also provides some useful features like sleeping bags, tents which let you sleep even if monsters are nearby as well as some decorational blocks like hollow logs and such.
